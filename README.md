Experiments on NLP

I have conducted 4 experiments in this python notebook with comparisons made between RNN and CNN on various optimizers and several word embedding techniques and tokenizers like Spacy, GloVe, Word2Vec and I have used PCA for dimentionality reduction. The task compiled in this notebook is a sequence labeling task where the tokens in a sentence will be converted to their respective NER tags.
